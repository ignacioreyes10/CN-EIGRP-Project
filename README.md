# EIGRP Load Balancing and Redundancy Setup

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to implement a redundant routed network using the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) and to automate its configuration using Python. EIGRP allows routers to dynamically exchange routing information, support load balancing, and provide fast convergence in case of link failure.

The network topology is designed in Cisco Packet Tracer, while the routing configuration is applied automatically through a Python script. This approach reflects a NetDevOps methodology, where network configuration is managed through code instead of manual CLI commands.

The project demonstrates equal-cost and unequal-cost load balancing, as well as network redundancy, showing how automation can simplify network management and reduce configuration errors.
